## 1. Introduction

The WirelessROS system is designed to create a tightly integrated robotic platform that is acutely aware of and can adapt to the conditions of the underlying wireless communication network. This architecture documentation delves into the specific implementation details of this system, focusing on how data from a real-world wireless communication project (OpenAirInterface) is integrated with the Robot Operating System (ROS) to enable intelligent and adaptive robotic behavior. The core idea is to empower the robot to make informed decisions and adjustments based on the quality and characteristics of its wireless connection, ultimately enhancing its performance and reliability in various operational scenarios. This document will not list code snippets but will instead explain the architectural choices, data flow, and the mechanisms that enable this integration and adaptation.

## 2. Overall System Architecture

The WirelessROS system employs a distributed architecture based on ROS, where different functionalities are encapsulated within independent nodes that communicate via topics, services, and actions. The central components of this architecture are the "Engines," which are ROS nodes responsible for specific aspects of the system's behavior. These Engines, namely the Radio Information Engine, the Physical Adaptive Engine, and the Cross Domain Engine, work collaboratively to achieve the system's objectives. The system also includes the necessary infrastructure to bridge the gap between the OpenAirInterface project and the ROS environment, allowing for the ingestion of crucial wireless communication parameters. The overall architecture promotes modularity, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for the addition of new functionalities and the modification of existing ones without affecting the entire system.

## 3. Data Acquisition from the Wireless Communication Layer

The ability to access real-time data from the wireless communication layer is fundamental to the WirelessROS system. This section details the various strategies considered and potentially implemented to extract relevant MAC layer parameters from the OpenAirInterface (OAI) project's `main.c` file and make them available within the ROS ecosystem.

### 3.1 Integration Strategy: ROS Node for MAC Layer Data

The primary strategy involves creating a dedicated ROS node that acts as an interface between the OAI world and the ROS world. This node is responsible for obtaining the MAC layer data and publishing it as ROS topics.

### 3.2 Scenario 1: Existing Data Storage (e.g., InfluxDB)

This is the preferred initial approach. If the `main.c` file is already configured to store MAC layer statistics in a database like InfluxDB, the implementation will involve creating a ROS node that:

* **Connects to the InfluxDB instance:** This node will establish a connection to the database where the OAI data is being stored.
* **Queries relevant data:** Based on predefined criteria or configuration, the node will periodically query the database for the necessary MAC layer parameters (e.g., throughput, latency, signal-to-noise ratio, resource block utilization).
* **Publishes as ROS topics:** The retrieved data will then be formatted into appropriate ROS messages and published on dedicated ROS topics. The topic names and message types will be chosen to clearly represent the information being conveyed. For example, topics like `/wireless/mac_stats/throughput`, `/wireless/mac_stats/latency`, etc., could be used with custom message definitions to hold the relevant data.

This approach has the advantage of minimizing modifications to the existing OAI codebase, leveraging its existing data storage mechanism.

### 3.3 Scenario 2: No Existing Data Storage - File Output

If the `main.c` file does not currently store the data, a less intrusive option would be to modify it to periodically output the relevant MAC layer parameters to a file. A ROS node would then be implemented to:

* **Read the output file:** The ROS node would monitor the file for new data being written by the OAI process.
* **Parse the data:** The node would parse the content of the file according to a predefined format.
* **Publish as ROS topics:** The parsed data would be converted into ROS messages and published on appropriate topics, similar to Scenario 1.

This approach requires some modification to the `main.c` file but keeps the changes relatively localized.

### 3.4 Scenario 3: No Existing Data Storage - Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Another option if direct file output is not desirable is to use other forms of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms. This could involve:

* **Shared Memory:** The `main.c` process could write the MAC layer data to a shared memory segment, which a ROS node could then read.
* **Sockets or Pipes:** The OAI process could send the data over a socket or pipe to a ROS node listening for incoming connections.

For each of these IPC methods, a corresponding ROS node would need to be implemented to interact with the chosen mechanism, retrieve the data, and publish it as ROS topics.

### 3.5 Scenario 4: Direct ROS Integration (Advanced)

A more tightly coupled approach would involve directly integrating ROS functionalities within the `main.c` codebase. This would require:

* **Including ROS client libraries:** Adding the necessary ROS client library headers to the `main.c` file.
* **Initializing a ROS node:** Adding code to initialize a ROS node within the OAI application's main function.
* **Publishing data directly:** Using the ROS publisher APIs to directly publish the MAC layer parameters as ROS topics from within the `main.c` process.

While this approach might offer lower latency and more direct control, it could also introduce more complexity in managing the OAI project's build and dependencies, as it would now depend on the ROS framework. This option would likely require more significant modifications to the existing OAI project structure.

## 4. Radio Information Engine

The Radio Information Engine acts as the central hub for processing and interpreting the raw wireless communication data obtained from the OAI integration layer. It subscribes to the ROS topics where the MAC layer parameters are published and transforms this data into a more meaningful and actionable format for the downstream Engines.

### 4.1 Topic Subscription and Data Reception

The Radio Information Engine is implemented as a standard ROS node and is configured to subscribe to the specific ROS topics where the MAC layer data is being published by the OAI integration node. It will listen for incoming messages on these topics and process them as they arrive.

### 4.2 Data Processing and Aggregation Logic

Upon receiving the raw MAC layer parameters, the Radio Information Engine applies various processing techniques. This might include:

* **Data Cleaning and Filtering:** Removing any erroneous or irrelevant data points.
* **Unit Conversion:** Ensuring all data is in a consistent and understandable unit system.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Calculating mean, variance, moving averages, or other statistical measures to identify trends and patterns in the radio data.
* **Thresholding and Anomaly Detection:** Identifying situations where the radio parameters fall outside acceptable ranges, indicating potential issues.
* **Data Aggregation:** Combining multiple raw parameters to derive higher-level metrics that provide a more comprehensive view of the wireless environment. For example, combining signal strength and error rate to calculate an overall link quality score.

### 4.3 Examples of Processed Radio Information

The Radio Information Engine might publish information such as:

* **Current Throughput:** The measured data transmission rate.
* **Average Latency:** The typical delay experienced in data packets.
* **Signal Quality Metrics:** Such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP), or Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
* **Resource Block Utilization:** The percentage of available radio resources being used.
* **Packet Error Rate:** The frequency of data packet loss.
* **Predicted Link Quality:** Forecasts of future wireless link quality based on historical trends.
* **Network Congestion Levels:** An indication of how busy the wireless network is.

### 4.4 Publication of Processed Information

The processed and aggregated radio information is then published by the Radio Information Engine on new ROS topics. These topics serve as the primary input for the Physical Adaptive Engine and the Cross Domain Engine. The message types for these topics will be designed to clearly convey the processed information in a structured manner.

## 5. Physical Adaptive Engine

The Physical Adaptive Engine leverages the processed radio information from the Radio Information Engine to make decisions and trigger actions that adapt the robot's physical configuration or behavior to optimize performance in the current wireless environment.

### 5.1 Subscription to Radio Information

The Physical Adaptive Engine subscribes to the ROS topics published by the Radio Information Engine, receiving the processed and aggregated wireless communication metrics.

### 5.2 Decision-Making Algorithms and Logic

Based on the received radio information, the Physical Adaptive Engine employs specific algorithms and logic to determine the appropriate physical adaptations. These algorithms might consider factors such as:

* **Signal Strength Thresholds:** If the signal strength drops below a certain threshold, the engine might initiate a relocation maneuver.
* **Latency Requirements:** If the current latency is too high for the robot's ongoing tasks, the engine might try to optimize the robot's orientation or position for better connectivity.
* **Bandwidth Availability:** If the available bandwidth is low, the engine might adjust the data transmission rate of sensors or prioritize critical communication streams.
* **Predictive Models:** Using the predicted link quality, the engine might proactively adjust the robot's path or behavior to avoid areas with anticipated poor connectivity.

### 5.3 Examples of Physical Adaptations

The Physical Adaptive Engine could trigger actions such as:

* **Robot Repositioning:** Moving the robot to a location with better wireless signal coverage.
* **Antenna Adjustment:** If the robot has adjustable antennas, the engine might change their orientation or polarization.
* **Sensor Configuration Changes:** Adjusting the sampling rate or resolution of sensors to reduce bandwidth consumption in low-bandwidth scenarios.
* **Power Management Adjustments:** Reducing the power consumption of non-critical components to conserve energy if network connectivity is unreliable.
* **Obstacle Avoidance Modifications:** Adapting the obstacle avoidance behavior based on the reliability of communication with remote control or coordination systems.

### 5.4 Communication of Adaptation Commands

The Physical Adaptive Engine communicates its decisions to other ROS nodes responsible for controlling the robot's physical actuators and sensors. This is typically done by publishing commands on specific control topics. For example, it might publish velocity commands to the robot's navigation system or configuration commands to sensor control nodes.

## 6. Cross Domain Engine

The Cross Domain Engine operates at a higher level, utilizing the radio information to make strategic decisions that impact multiple domains or subsystems within the robotic system. It focuses on coordinating actions and optimizing overall system behavior based on the current and predicted wireless communication conditions.

### 6.1 Subscription to Radio Information

Similar to the Physical Adaptive Engine, the Cross Domain Engine subscribes to the processed radio information published by the Radio Information Engine.

### 6.2 High-Level Coordination and Decision Making

The Cross Domain Engine employs more complex logic to make high-level decisions, considering the interplay between different robotic functionalities and the state of the wireless network. This might involve:

* **Task Prioritization:** Adjusting the priority of different tasks based on the reliability and bandwidth of the network. For example, in a degraded network environment, the engine might prioritize safety-critical tasks over less important ones.
* **Resource Allocation:** Dynamically allocating computational or communication resources to different subsystems based on their needs and the available network capacity.
* **Mission Planning Adjustments:** Modifying the robot's planned mission or trajectory to avoid areas with poor network coverage or to take advantage of areas with strong connectivity for data-intensive tasks.
* **Collaboration Management:** In multi-robot systems, the engine might coordinate the actions of multiple robots based on their individual network conditions and the overall network status.

### 6.3 Examples of Cross-Domain Coordination

The Cross Domain Engine could initiate actions such as:

* **Switching to a more robust communication protocol:** If the current protocol is experiencing issues due to poor network conditions.
* **Deferring data-intensive tasks:** Scheduling tasks that require high bandwidth for times when the network is less congested.
* **Requesting assistance from other robots:** In a collaborative scenario, if one robot has a poor connection, the engine might task another robot with relaying information.
* **Alerting human operators:** Notifying operators about critical network conditions that might impact the robot's operation.

### 6.4 Communication with Other Subsystems

The Cross Domain Engine communicates its decisions and directives to other relevant ROS nodes, potentially influencing the behavior of navigation, perception, manipulation, or other high-level control systems. This could involve publishing commands, updating task parameters, or sending notifications to other nodes.

## 7. ROS Integration and Communication in Detail

ROS forms the backbone of the WirelessROS system, providing a robust and flexible framework for communication and coordination.

### 7.1 Detailed Topic Usage and Message Definitions

The system relies heavily on ROS topics for asynchronous communication. Specific topics will be defined for:

* **Raw MAC Layer Data:** Published by the OAI integration node, containing the extracted parameters. Custom message definitions will be created to represent the structure of this data.
* **Processed Radio Information:** Published by the Radio Information Engine, containing the aggregated and analyzed wireless metrics. Again, custom message definitions will be used.
* **Physical Adaptation Commands:** Published by the Physical Adaptive Engine, instructing other nodes to adjust the robot's physical parameters. Standard ROS message types (e.g., `geometry_msgs/Twist` for motion commands, custom messages for sensor configurations) might be used.
* **Cross-Domain Directives:** Published by the Cross Domain Engine, conveying high-level decisions and coordination commands to other subsystems. These might also utilize custom message definitions tailored to the specific commands being issued.

### 7.2 Potential Use of ROS Services and Actions

In addition to topics, ROS services and actions could be used for more request-response or goal-oriented interactions. For example:

* **A ROS service could be used by the Physical Adaptive Engine to request the robot's current location from a navigation service.**
* **A ROS action could be used by the Cross Domain Engine to initiate a complex mission planning adjustment that might take a longer time to complete.**

The specific use of services and actions will depend on the complexity and nature of the interactions required between different components.

### 7.3 Parameter Management

ROS parameters will be used to configure the behavior of the different Engines and the OAI integration node. This allows for easy adjustment of settings such as:

* **Data acquisition rates.**
* **Thresholds for triggering adaptive behaviors.**
* **Weights and parameters for decision-making algorithms.**
* **Network configuration details.**

### 7.4 Node Lifecycle Management

ROS provides tools for managing the lifecycle of nodes, ensuring that they are properly initialized, started, stopped, and potentially restarted in case of failures. This is crucial for the robustness and reliability of the WirelessROS system.

## 8. Data Flow Through the System

Understanding the flow of data is essential for comprehending the system's operation.

### 8.1 From OpenAirInterface to ROS Topics

The process begins with the extraction of MAC layer data from the OpenAirInterface project's `main.c` file. This data is then published as ROS messages on specific topics by the OAI integration node. The exact mechanism for data extraction (database query, file reading, IPC, or direct ROS integration) will determine the specifics of this step.

### 8.2 Processing in the Radio Information Engine

The Radio Information Engine subscribes to these raw data topics. Upon receiving the messages, it performs various processing steps, including cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and statistical analysis, to derive meaningful insights about the current and predicted wireless network conditions. The results of this processing are then published on new ROS topics.

### 8.3 Utilization by the Physical Adaptive and Cross Domain Engines

Both the Physical Adaptive Engine and the Cross Domain Engine subscribe to the processed radio information topics published by the Radio Information Engine. They then utilize this information, along with their respective decision-making logic and algorithms, to determine appropriate actions. The Physical Adaptive Engine focuses on low-level physical adaptations of the robot, while the Cross Domain Engine makes high-level strategic decisions affecting multiple subsystems. Both Engines communicate their decisions and commands to other relevant ROS nodes within the system.

## 9. Resource Management within the WirelessROS System

The WirelessROS system incorporates mechanisms for managing and allocating resources efficiently, taking into account the dynamic nature of the wireless environment and the varying demands of different tasks.

### 9.1 Priority-Based Allocation

The system can prioritize certain tasks or components based on their criticality or urgency. Resource allocation, such as network bandwidth or computational power, can then be adjusted to favor these higher-priority elements, ensuring that essential functions are maintained even under resource-constrained conditions.

### 9.2 Fair Share Algorithm

To prevent any single component from monopolizing resources, a fair share algorithm can be implemented. This ensures that all active components receive a minimum allocation of necessary resources, promoting stability and preventing starvation of lower-priority tasks.

### 9.3 Congestion Detection

The system actively monitors resource utilization and network traffic to detect potential congestion points before they significantly impact performance. Upon detecting congestion, the system can proactively take measures such as reducing the data transmission rates of non-critical components or adjusting task scheduling to alleviate the bottleneck.
